# NoneScript
### At the moment, just another programming language prototype

---

I (Calebe Souza) really want to take it seriously, but i don't know if i will.

## Inspiration

NoneScript's syntax is like a mixture of many different languages.  
Including:
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/);
- [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp);
- [Lua](https://lua.org/) and also
- [Gulf Of Mexico \(old Dreamberd\)](https://github.com/TodePond/GultOfMexico).

> It may take things from other languages too.

# Some tasks that i need to finish

- [ ] Create a `makefile`
- [ ] Define what language to use in this project

> Would be C or Rust...

## After choosing a language, we need to:

- [ ] **First:** handle different commands. Those are:

1. `run`
    1. Will find a specific file.
    2. Load it's content.
    3. Do some configuration based on that content;
    4. Run the program.

2. `new`
    1. Will take one argument (which will be the project name).
    2. Create a <name> folder.
    3. Inside the folder, will create that specific config file.
    4. And also, the `main.ns` inside `<name>/Source/` containing that most beloved **'Hello World Program'** snippet

> At least the two commands above...

3. `build` ***because i want to code a compiler in the future***
4. `check`
    1. Just like Cargo \(Rust's package manager\). It will check if your program will compile, without really doing it.


- [ ] **Second:** get all content inside every `.ns` file 
in `Source/` folder.
